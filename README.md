This is a work-in-progress toolkit to make web game development easier. It is currently mainly aimed at React and [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) projects, but it can be used in non-React projects as well.

üõë **Not ready for public use**: The published TypeScript and React files are not compiled at the moment. If your `tsconfig.json` settings differ from what the library expects, it might break. It is based on Vite's tsconfig.

## Installation

Mana Potion consists of:

- [**`@manapotion/react`**](#react-listeners-store-and-hooks): React listeners, store, and hooks
- [**`@manapotion/browser`**](#browser-api-helpers): Browser API helpers
- [**`@manapotion/r3f`**](#react-three-fiber): React Three Fiber WebGPU canvas
- [**`@manapotion/util`**](#utilities): General gamedev utilities
- **`manapotion`**: All of the above in one package that exports everything

If you are making a React Three Fiber game, the easiest option is to add `manapotion` to your project:

```sh
# NPM
npm install manapotion
# Yarn
yarn add manapotion
# PNPM
pnpm add manapotion
# Bun
bun add manapotion
```

For React projects that don't use R3F, non-React projects, or if you are not interested in all of the features of Mana Potion, install the packages that are relevant to you independently. For example:

```sh
# NPM
npm install @manapotion/react @manapotion/browser
# Yarn
yarn add @manapotion/react @manapotion/browser
# PNPM
pnpm add @manapotion/react @manapotion/browser
# Bun
bun add @manapotion/react @manapotion/browser
```

## React Listeners, Store, and Hooks

‚öõÔ∏è **`@manapotion/react`** is the main package of Mana Potion. It contains listeners that update a reactive store which you can use as a hook in your components or access directly in your imperative code.

The listeners available are:

- `<MouseDownListener />`
- `<MouseMoveListener />`
- `<PointerLockListener />`
- `<FullscreenChangeListener />`
- `<ResizeListener />`
- `<CanHoverListener />`
- `<PageVisibilityListener />`

To enable them all, simply add `<Listeners />` to your app:

```jsx
import { Listeners } from '@manapotion/react'
// or
// import { Listeners } from 'manapotion

const App = () => (
  <>
    <div>Your game</div>
    <Listeners />
  </>
)
```

Access reactive variables with the `useMP` hook, and use [helper functions](#helpers) to trigger common browser events:

```jsx
import { useMP } from 'manapotion'

const Header = () => {
  const isFullscreen = useMP(s => s.isFullscreen)

  return <div>{isFullscreen ? 'You are fullscreen' : 'You are not fullscreen'}</div>
}
```

If you need to access the state outside of a component's lifecycle, you can use `mp()`:

```jsx
import { mp } from 'manapotion'

const myMainUpdateLoop = () => {
  const { isRightMouseDown } = mp()
  // ...
}
```

Some variables that update very frequently such as mouse position are available in two flavors:

- Reactive but throttled via `useMP` for when you want to trigger React re-renders.
- Non-reactive but always up-to-date via `mp` to use in your animation loops:

```jsx
const Camera = () => {
  useFrame(() => {
    const { mouseMovementX, mouseMovementY } = mp()
    // ...
  })
  // ...
}
```

Here is the list of available variables. Variables that are both reactive and non-reactive are marked with a ‚ö°Ô∏è.

- `useUIFrame`: Like R3F `useFrame` but for your UI updates.

### üåê General browser state

- `isPointerLocked`
- `isFullscreen`
- `isPageVisible`
- `canHover` (you can think of it as "is desktop". Mobile and touch devices will return `false`.)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è `width` (of the window)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è `height` (of the window)

### üïπ Inputs

- `isLeftMouseDown`
- `isMiddleMouseDown`
- `isRightMouseDown`
- ‚ö°Ô∏è `mouseX`
- ‚ö°Ô∏è `mouseY` (the bottom of the screen is 0)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è `mouseMovementX`
- ‚ö°Ô∏è `mouseMovementY` (going up is positive)

### Callbacks

You can provide custom event callbacks to `<Listeners />`.

```jsx
<Listeners onPointerLockChange={isPointerLocked => console.log(isPointerLocked)} />
```

**Note to myself**: Check that making them stable with `useCallback` is not necessary.

## Browser API Helpers

üåê **`@manapotion/browser`** provides helper functions to abstract some browser APIs:

- `enterFullscreen`
- `exitFullscreen`
- `lockOrientation`
- `unlockOrientation`
- `lockPointer`
- `unlockPointer`
- `lockKeys`
- `unlockKeys`

For a fully immersive experience of an FPS game for example, when the player clicks Play or the Fullscreen button, you might want to call multiple helpers in a row like this:

```jsx
import {
  enterFullscreen,
  exitFullscreen,
  lockOrientation,
  unlockOrientation,
  lockKeys,
  unlockKeys,
} from '@manapotion/browser'

const FullscreenButton = () => (
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      if (isFullscreen) {
        exitFullscreen()
        unlockKeys()
        unlockOrientation()
      } else {
        enterFullscreen()
        lockOrientation('landscape')
        lockKeys(['Escape'])
      }
    }}
  >
    Toggle fullscreen
  </button>
)
```

**Note**: Locking keys is a [Chrome experimental feature](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/better-full-screen-mode) to maintain fullscreen when players press Esc (they have to hold it instead). It lets games show in-game dialogs that players can close with Esc without leaving fullscreen.

## React Three Fiber

‚öõÔ∏è **`@manapotion/r3f`** currently includes a single component: a wrapper around R3F's `Canvas` that automatically enables WebGPU if supported.

```jsx
import { Canvas } from '@manapotion/r3f'

const App = () => <Canvas forceWebGL={false}>{/* Your scene */}</Canvas>
```

üëâ Due to the way Three.js' WebGPURenderer is written, your bundler must support **top-level await** ([Vite example](https://github.com/verekia/manapotion/blob/main/example/vite.config.ts)).

To know if your canvas is currently using WebGPU or WebGL, you can use `useThree` inside the canvas:

```jsx
const Scene = () => {
  const gl = useThree(s => s.gl)

  console.log(gl.isWebGLRenderer)
  console.log(gl.isWebGPURenderer)

  // ...
}
```

For a canvas that takes up the entire screen and resizes nicely on mobile, you can use:

```css
html {
  height: 100dvh;
}

body,
#root {
  height: 100%;
}
```

With Tailwind:

```html
<html class="h-dvh">
  <body class="h-full">
    <div id="root" class="h-full"><!-- App --></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

# Utilities

üõ† **`@manapotion/util`** provides a few utility functions that are useful for JS gamedev in general.

- `lerp`: Linear interpolation.
- `clamp`: Clamps a number between a minimum and a maximum value.
- `throttle`: Throttles a function by a given time in ms.
- `debounce`: Debounces a function by a given time in ms.
- `throttleDebounce`: Throttles a function by a given time in ms, but also makes a final call to it after the throttle time has passed.
- `pi`: A less verbose `Math.PI`.
